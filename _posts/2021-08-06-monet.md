*"The sun sets so fast that I cannot follow it…. The more I continue, the more I see that a great deal of work is necessary in order to succeed in rendering that which I seek: "instantaneity", especially the "envelope", the same light spreading everywhere…."*

*Claude Monet, October 7, 1890 (Seitz 25)*

In Japanese Buddhism, the reality is a constant change or "impermanence". (Park & Loughnane) Fascinated by the question of impermanence in nature and the basis of reality, Monet captured the changing natural qualities in obsessive fervour as if seeking enlightenment. Inspired by Hokusai's Thirty-Six Views of the Mount Fuji, Monet then created several series such as the Haystacks, Poplars and Rouen Cathedral where the subject is fixated on one object.

*Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji is a series of landscape prints by the Japanese ukiyo-e artist Hokusai (1760–1849). The series depicts Mount Fuji from different locations and in various seasons and weather conditions. This is the “Fine Wind, Clear Morning” that could be a testament to the spiritual influence to Claude Monet as it was hung prominently in Monet’s Giverny house. (Monet & Japan, Australian National Gallery)*


By painting the Haystacks from the same angle during different times of the day and seasons, Monet captured the immediacy of the “envelope” and “instantaneity” (Seitz 25) that reflects the transience of life. Similarly, the Poplars Series exhibits Monet’s pursuit of the evanescent scenes that reportedly lasted “only seven minutes” or “until the sunlight left a certain leaf”. (Seitz 26)

Notably, the Rouen Cathedral Series manifests as a peak in Monet’s materialization of the ephemeral especially when it is and should, as Monet stressed, be viewed as a whole to truly appreciate each moment and the whole aspect of reality (Metropolitan Musuem of Arts, 12).

Although Monet did not openly endorse the spirituality presented in these artworks, but from his implicit and increasing obsession with ephemeral effects and nature’s activities, a much-devaluated transcendentalism akin to impermanence of life can be observed.
