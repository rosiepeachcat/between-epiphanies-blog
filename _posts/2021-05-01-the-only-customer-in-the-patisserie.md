I’m sure everyone has surely woken up tear-stained for once in their entire life. The moment you open your eyes feels as if you’ve plunged your face into freezing cold water and you wake up groggy from all your previous life. It is as if you’ve just regained consciousness after your anaesthesia has worn off but your body is still benumbed and you’re so nerveless you can’t even lift your finger. Opposite to brain dead, your mind has never been this clear before. Your senses sharpen and suddenly everything becomes so clear to you like the dawn of an oracle.

School is mundane as usual.

“X, there’s a new café nearby the school. Let’s go there together after school!”

“Do they have cheesecake?”

“It’s their specialty.”

“Okay.”

We go to the cafe by foot. It’s a cloudy and windy day so there’s no scorching heat that vaporizes virtually everything.

“Y, have you ever wanted to fly a plane?”

“Of course not, why ask?”

“I was flying a plane in my dream.”

“Oh? Where did you fly your plane to?”

“I didn’t know where I wanted to go nor did I have any directions.”

“Ah…I thought maybe you had flown to Paris or Greece…”

“It doesn’t really matter if you don’t know where to go if you know how to fly the plane. You can land when you’re running out of fuel. But if you don’t know how to fly, even if you have a destination in mind, you’ll crash anyway.”

“If you don’t know how to fly a plane, why get into the pilot seat at the first place? Moreover, it’s okay, we have pilots to fly us to anywhere we want to. Don’t worry.”

“You don’t understand, like it or not, we are all flying a plane…”

“Ah! I’ll let you off the hook for now. I don’t care. This is on you.”

We order our cakes at the counter. Y is fidgety and tensed, averting her eyes from the cashier. She is having a slice of strawberry cake and I order a piece of cheesecake.

“X, have you ever had a very weird experience?”

“It all depends on what you mean by weird.”

“There’s something I’ve not told anyone but it’s been bothering me a lot lately. I need to confide in someone and I think I can and I want to tell you about it. Is it okay?” She has a troubled expression on her face.

I nod my head in agreement.

“There was a time I went to a café after school. You were reading in the library so I went alone. The shop was just in the next district and it was decorated lavishly with lace and floral prints. The pastries on the window display were so delicate and I just dashed into the shop without hesitation. I was so absorbed in the prospect of eating these dulcet delicacies my eyes were riveted to the pastries in the glass fridge and the menu on the table. The shop was deserted but I didn’t really think it was strange. So, when I was going to place my order at the cashier, I noticed something really weird. The male cashier and the waitresses had the same androgynous face! I…I thought I was in a delusion but it was real. I panicked… Of course I’d be aghast. When I came back to my senses, I darted to the door. I didn’t know what I was afraid of but I just knew I had to get out of that place,” Y pauses and drinks and a mouthful of water.

“I didn’t make it…They caught me from behind and bound my hands and legs. They were standing looming over me, staring at me with their identical faces. I was so petrified my tears kept pouring out. Then, they demanded me to work for them until my last breath and that my face would gradually mutilate and become the same as theirs. I kept screaming and when they discovered I had no skills whatsoever, they adjured me to do the dishwashing. I didn’t want that… I didn’t want to clean the dishes for the rest of my life wearing the same visage like them. I wanted to keep my face. When they freed me to let me change into their uniform, I mustered all my energy and ran to the door. I bit and kicked the hands that were trying to hold me back. I just kept running.”
Y looks up and meets my eye.

“I made it… I made it to the streets and I ran back home like some crazy person. I couldn’t bring my legs to stop and never once did I look back to that place.” She smiles wearily, fuddling her fingers.

“I went to the district last week, partly because I wanted to check that shop out. But the thing is, it was gone. The shop had completely vanished and it became a dark alley. More like it was an alley, there wasn’t any shop to begin with. I thought it was just an illusion so I went to see it again on the next day. But it’s not there.”

“Now I think maybe that incident was just a figment of my imagination. It’s really absurd, right? I didn’t dare to tell anyone about this because they’d just think I’m nuts. It’s okay if you don’t believe this dumb story…I mean, even the shop’s gone now,” Y chuckles nervously and awkwardly.

“Because you made it out.”

“Huh? I don’t quite catch you.”

“Because you made it out. That’s why the shop’s gone.”

Y looks bewildered at my response and whispers gratefully, “Thank you for believing me, X. Yes…I made it out.”

We part way at the junction in front of our neighbourhood. Y lives a street down my house.

“You can always call me if you want to go to a café again. I can read another time.”

Y nods, smiling all the way.
