Monet’s interest in Japanese art and culture intensified as his career progressed. In Monet’s Giverny House, extensive collections of Japanese prints further suggest the subconscious influence of Japanese Buddhism thought in his paintings.

Moreover, it can also be seen in his obsession with waterlilies which he further pointed that the waterlilies paintings5 are, in fact, “object of contemplation”. Since his garden in Giverny was partly conceived in emulation of Japanese exemplar and was planted with lotus, he must be aware of their rich Buddhist symbolism—enlightenment.

Even in the mural-size Nymphaea series Monet created for the Orangerie Museum, he wanted to “offer (an) asylum of peaceful meditation in the centre of flowering aquarium”.

At the end, whether Monet was spiritually influenced by Japonisme remains ambiguous. However, his perpetual obsession to the end with his Japanese garden, even after he stopped to talk at all of paintings (Varnedoe), can be construed as his answer.
