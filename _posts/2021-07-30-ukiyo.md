With "uki" for sadness and "yo" for life, the original characters used for Ukiyo 浮世meant "sad world". It connotes the Buddhist notion of the transience of life (Yonemura 4; Asai). Ironically, during the early Edo period, another ideograph which meant "floating", similarly pronounced as "uki" came into usage and Ukiyo-e became associated with the indulgence of life's pleasure. Therefore, the idyllic narratives of Ukiyo-e document not only the leisure activities and climate of the era, but also the natural landscapes of Japan.

Correspondingly, the subtle influence of Buddhist’s impermanence of life is observed in Impressionism. In accepting impermanence, full enjoyment of life can be seen in Impressionists’ focus on mundane subjects such as luncheons, parties and intimate private scenes in their contemporary lives. On the same note, their obsession with the “fleeting moment” and the accurate depiction of specific atmospheric conditions can be seen as an inspiration of the “essence” that marked the passing of time in Ukiyo-e paintings. Notably, the manifestation of Japanese spirituality peaked in the landscape paintings in Impressionism.

Irrefutably, startling similarities in stylistic elements between Impressionist paintings and Japanese oeuvre that suggest certain spiritual influence. Nevertheless, some art critics remain skeptical about the causative effect derived from similarities. (Lewis 382). Primarily, their concern of revisiting Japonisme and the notion of “influence” with an art-historical method is best represented by Michael Foucault’s quote: “too magical (in) kind to be amenable to analysis” in exploring the phenomenon of resemblance or repetition.

However, broad literature suggests that there are indeed implicit Japanese spiritual ideals evident in the choices of subject matter and stylistical rendering of Impressionist painting. According to Brown and Hutton, the main common aspect of Asian art is its spiritual nature, especially after the rise of Buddhism. 

Specifically, Ukiyo-e has its basis in Buddhism. Subsequently, it is postulated that Impressionist painters will have inadvertently receive spiritual influences from Ukiyo-e. Admittedly, “imaginative leaps” might have been made, but only when the work is viewed through the lens of Buddhism that seems to significantly enhance its interpretation. (Baas 10) At the risk of myopia, however, other factors have been overlooked to present as clear a case of study of Japonisme as possible, and to test this notion stringently against the oeuvre under consideration.

**Whistlerian Influence: Atmospheric Conditions**

The mystical landscape Impressionist paintings are known for are suggested to be influenced by Whistler’s Nocturnes which have been heavily influenced by Ukiyo-e prints. The hazy atmosphere in the Nocturnes suggests the “night effects” Hiroshige is renowned for. Therefore, it is the immateriality of these paintings, plus Whistler’s already established association with the Japanese—a people known as naturally spiritual—that sparked associations with the spirituality of the Japanese. (Burns 70). According to Freer (Yonemura et. Al 138), “one feels the exercise of spiritual influences similar to those of the masters of Chinese and Japanese art” in Whistler’s art.

The Whistlerian Influence extending to Impressionism is not arbitrary, but substantiated by his acquaintance with Claude Monet and Edouard Manet through artistic exchange in London and Paris. The misty sunset captured in Manet’s Boats at Sea, Sunset is reminiscent of Whistler’s Nocturne: Blue and Gold, Southampton Water and their shared interest in Hiroshige. (Spencer 57)

Similarly, in Monet’s The Thames below Westminster, the fog-obscured architecture in the background shows evidence of Whistlerian Influence.

This applies to Monet's Impression: Sunrise as well. With the mediation of Whistler, Monet borrowed the atmospheric prints of Hiroshige where the evocative quality and sense of nature is captured.  However, it is in [Monet’s landscape paintings]() where the Japanese spirituality of nature is depicted with extreme poignancy.
