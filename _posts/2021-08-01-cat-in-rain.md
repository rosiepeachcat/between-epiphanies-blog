I’m on my way home after work. I’m drenched, not with perspiration but rain. The sky is ominously dark and grey clouds are patched on the wide sky, obscuring the sun. Everything is under a veil of penumbra.

My footsteps are light on the wet asphalt as I carefully avoid the pools of water. My umbrella is in my shoulder bag but I feel like catching the rain today. Rivulets of raindrops pelt on my clothes. Sometimes, globules of heaven’s tears drip on my bag, sipping into the cloth. The trees are rustling in the wind. Flocks of birds are fluttering their wings and chirping as they flee from the branches.

I stand on the pedestrian sidewalk. The road is deserted as it is in a quiet neighbourhood on the hill. A stray cat is licking its paw beside me as I rest my back on the railing.

“It’s raining, little cat. Go find yourself a shelter.”

“What? You can be in the rain but I can’t?” The cat is irritated with my disturbance.

“Well, I didn’t mean it that way…You might catch a cold.”

“You might catch a cold too, but I guess fools don’t catch colds easily.”

I ignore its witty remark. “What’s your name, little cat?”

“What’s with you humans and the desire to name everything? Well, I don’t have a name.”

“You don’t have a name?”

“Yes, you got me. I don’t have a name. I don’t like names, such a bore. What’s your name, human?”

“R. Why do you dislike names?”

“Without a name, I’m no one and anyone. Isn’t that nice?”

“Well, I suppose so. But don’t you think a name is a label of your existence, something that belongs only to you.”

“A name doesn’t prove an existence just like existence is not denied for the nameless.”

“Don’t you think a name gives you a sense of belonging? Like it is who you are so you won’t be lost in this changing and contemporary world.”

“R, you don’t need to be nameless to be lost.”

I’m stunned. The cat has a point. The rain keeps pouring but we keep on talking.

“Have you ever been lost, cat?”

“Let me tell you a story, human.” I perk my ears, listening to the cat’s story.

“There was a time I sashayed to a family café owned by a family of cows. Their signature drink was the hot fresh milk. It was directly and instantly milked from the mother cows when you put down your order, so the freshness was guaranteed. I was lactose intolerant but carpe diem, you know the saying, when in Rome do what the Romans do. Everyone had a cup of hot fresh milk on their table so I got myself a cup of hot fresh milk too. The repercussion was miserable: I threw up the sardines I ate that morning and I slept hurdled up for three days.”

“Since you knew you were lactose intolerant, why did you put yourself through the torturous suffering?”

“I guess you can say I was trying to blend in. There is no gainsaying that the sense of belonging is wickedly tempting, but life doesn’t always go how you want it to. So, I continued to find a place of belonging until I met a litter of backstreet cats did an epiphany hit me. I realized I was different and a solitary life best suited me, so I came to accept myself and freed myself from the social constructs.”

“Where are your family?”

“Nah, I bet we probably passed each other on the streets not knowing we were blood-related. We were separated at birth.”

“You mentioned about meeting a litter of backstreet cats, what happened? You didn’t like them?”

“Oh god. I was ostracised, more like I secluded myself on my own volition. They ate garbage and all they were worried about were mating seasons and lice. I wasn’t happy with them even though we were of the same kind. Even how we meowed was different. In the end, I couldn’t stand it anymore and I left the place. I tried again and again with other cats but there was never once a happy ending. At first, I thought something was irreparably wrong with me but I learned to accept myself. Voila, now you have a nameless cat living its own ideal life.”

“Ideal life?”

“I stay in a local bookstore in the town. Every day, I read to my heart’s content to satiate my appetite for knowledge. The owner even feeds me healthily baked tuna or mackerel every meal.”

“I’m glad you found a place you like.”

“Yea, me too.”

“I bet everyone likes to talk to you, you must be loved by many.”

“No, I only talk to you. And more like you understand what I’m talking about that’s why you enjoyed talking to me.”

The cat stretches and shakes the moisture off its silky fur. “R, you’ll find it, the place you’re looking for.” The cat straightens its tail and catwalks down the hill, probably to the bookstore for his dinner.

“Hey! What does your owner call you?” I shout to the cat.

“Nothing! I know it when he’s talking to me.”

The wind has abated and the rain has tapered to just a drizzle. The smell of petrichor rises from the earth. I take a deep breath and start to walk back home. Perhaps one day, I’ll my place in this vast world.
