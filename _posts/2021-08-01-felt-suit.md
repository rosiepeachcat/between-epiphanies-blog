Patrick skins the calf with impeccable precision, meticulously extracting a thin peel of skin and the layer of flavescent fat that hides under the skin. Carmine soils his lissome fingers that had a waltz with the knife. He eyes his masterpiece emptily and peers over to drown himself in the essence emitted by the suit hung on the wall.

He then sears the chunk of skinned calf in a pan, gently nudging the dead mass with a wooden spatula as it sizzles in the pan. Patrick breathes in effortlessly, indulging in the aroma as the chunk of flesh gradually loses its appalling red and in turn dons a golden coat. He smirks knowingly, smarting at his culinary forte and his acumen for excellent meat.

He pleasures himself with a gastronomical delight, contemplating his next catch. He admires his suit excessively, a smile subconsciously titillating the corner of his mouth. Not when an acrid observation becomes a blithe to his self-centered happiness. A spot of red taints the hem of the sleeve. He mumbles profanities at the mere sight of it. However, that annoyance subdues as rapid as Patrick remembers how sublime the meat of that pathetic man tasted in his mouth and how thrilling it felt to slice the man’s neck with a scalpel. Seven slits on the artillery throbbing under the neck. Patrick savors the intense morbidity as he looks at the moribund man.  

That pathetic man was arrogant and full of himself, so innocent that he thought his skills could checkmate Patrick in a chess game. 

In a reverie, the suit beckons Patrick to don it, tempting it devilishly. An insatiable thirst for a new catch acts an impetus propelling Patrick to wear the suit. It fits Patrick better than his ex-wife, he grimaces. He brushes off a non-existent dust off his suit, marveling at the texture and cutting of the suit.

He heaves a sigh of relief, feeling in control as he puts on the suit. The kaleidoscopic lights illuminate the lonely city and Patrick strides out confidently in his beloved suit to hunt his next prey.

To see quarry, killed with elegance, it's just moving to Patrick. The hunter has grace, beauty and purity of heart to be found nowhere else. It is a zero-sum game; the satiety of the predator is built on the expense of the life of the prey and the death of the prey invokes the beauty of slaughter.

‘Well, predators. You can make no distinction between what they are and what they do. And what they do is kill. We, of course, are another matter. It is our faintness of heart that has driven us to the edge of ruin. Perhaps you won't agree, but nothing is crueller than a coward. And the slaughter to come is probably beyond our imagining,’ the man clad in a suit speaks with poise. The woman sitting across him frowns inconspicuously.

‘I think you’ve told me more than I wish to know,’ the woman whispers timidly. 

‘Well, then I’ll say no more. Shall we think about ordering? I’m starving,’ he brushes her knuckles softly and strangely, his thumb is eerily warm as if his fingers were burning, yearning for something cold – a scalpel.
