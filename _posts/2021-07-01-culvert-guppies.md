My fingers stroke the obscured edge of the car seat. I look at the person next to me. His eyes fixated on the road; his mind lost in his own reverie or contemplation on something prickly, I feel it’s the latter. After all, I could sense the subtle rumble of ominous memories in the back of his mind. He has been very quiet since we bumped into his old acquaintances before leaving the restaurant. His jaw clenches tersely as he goes deeper into his own world. K living in the world of K with K’s own way, this thought echoes in my mind as I observe his grip on the steering wheel. 

Since when have I let my gaze wander from the world beyond the window?

My thumb caresses his jaw and he tightens his lips grimly. Breathing a sigh of relief as if he had made up his mind to break the silence, he mutters softly, “something happened between us and I just couldn’t stand the sight of them… It’s not something serious but,” he pauses. “Termites have digested the wood that buttresses our relationship… I don’t have anything to say to them.” I nod. Human relationships are like young trees: lack of one essential factor, the rings in the bark will stultify and parasites will infest clandestinely until one day all that is left is a wilted tree. I ponder on the scurrying existence of the stealthy termites and kiss the back of his hand.

“This was one of my secret hideouts,” K hushes with his entranced eyes fixated on the infinitesimal stretch of a gargantuan sea just at the end of the ginnel that trails before us. Was? “Now that you’re cognizant of this sanctum, I can’t have solecism disconcerting my little cat, can I?”, as if reading my mind K smiles knowingly and I chime with his epigrammatic remark. The sound of the waves gently lapping the shore and the susurration of the cordate leaves engulf us as we near the sea. As we stand on the small cliff, the sea is ours just like how the sea is the leviathan’s. Horizon after horizon, the ethereal sea gleams with phosphorescence. 

I point to a spot under a canopy and we both sit down side by side tacitly. Ants scramble around us like scattered black seeds. I rest my head on his shoulder and my fingers search for his. Inexplicable; time ceases to exist between us as if we are the time being instead of lulling on the fringe of time in fear of being chagrined and expelled. My eyes meet his gingerbread orbs that glimmer inconspicuously under the sunlight. 

“It’s okay…,” I placate as his eyes search for mine. 

Spring is passing

The birds cry and the fishes fill

With tears in their eyes

Tears they crystallise

Eyes glazed with ostentatious elan

Shed and fell—autumn leaves


On the white poppy

a butterfly’s torn wing

is a keepsake


“I used to sit here and let the waves carry me to some halcyon place. The verisimilitude of the sea calms my mind but like the sea, the depth of the heart is tenebrous. But being here with you now feels different,” K pauses in a daze and blurts out a beautiful analogy, “like a dragonfly has finally landed on that wispy blade of grass.” I moan in delight, “but the first fallen snow is barely enough to bend the jonquil leaves.” We laugh lightly and he pecks my forehead gingerly. 

“N?” K heaves himself up from the rocks and offers me his hand. Gladly accepting his hand, we meander through the stairs adroitly chiselled from the rocks to the lower shore adorned with an untarnished beach. There is a culvert on our left. A perpetual streamlet of rivulets dribbles towards the vast sea. The brook flows tranquilly as we stand on the shore where the clear meets the tangy. We stand there, letting the chilly spring water sooth our sore feet.

“Look,” K beckons me with a little merry wave as his eyes wander fleetingly to the culvert. Taking in one last look of the desultory flat horizon devoid of any curvature from my myopic perspective, I amble towards the culvert. 

“Guppies!” K announces spiritly. Amazed, I grin silently and inch closer to look at the guppies swimming untrammelled in the mossy culvert, ignorant of our innocuous intrusion. 

A swish of tail fins

Psychedelic scales glimmering chastely

Down into the dark

Water trickles down the stream

Guppies swimming against the current

Life moves on

Struggling against the current that sways them into an interminable loop of perpetual saline, the guppies swim strenuously to survive. Aren’t we just like the guppies living in that seemingly inhospitable and enigmatic culvert?
