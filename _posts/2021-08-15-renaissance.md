The Renaissance era is construed as the “illumination of enlightenment” after the Medieval darkness of ignorance. In scorning the Middle Ages and its ‘scholasticism’, Renaissance humanists looked back admiringly to classical values and ideals. In doing so, they turned men’s eyes from the Heaven back towards earth, to an appreciation of human life in its temporal and secular setting without turning their faith from God. During that time, “a belief in the identity of the human spirit under all previous manifestations, and in its uninterrupted continuity, was generated” (Symonds, 6) and a man-centred culture was born followed with the introduction of humanistic studies. Accordingly, the three directions of humanistic studies: philological and philosophical, epigraphic and archaeological, scientific and mathematical eloquently suggested the required knowledge to metamorphose into an individual who is the master of his own fate. Concomitantly, they enabled the visual manifestation of the humanist ideas while the artists became the pivotal force in the creative expression of the values of that time financed by secular and papal patronage. This essay will examine the concept of Humanism in relation to its progression in artistic innovation and the existential awareness of the people of that time seen in Renaissance paintings. The two perspectives will be examined in separate chronological order to enable a more comprehensive analysis.

The Avant-Garde of the Antiquity

According to Protagoras, man is created after the perfect image of God, so “man can be the measure of all things”. As the significance attributed to humanity and the individual flourished, so did the interest in the accurate depiction of human body. The most archetypal transformation can be observed in attempt to humanize sacred themes and figures. Essentially, the scared figures were brought closer to humanity through the art of depth, perspective and human-representation. For instance, Masaccio’s Holy Trinity holistically encompasses the pioneering application of mathematics to the depiction of space according to Brunelleschi’s linear perspectival scheme along with the emotions imbued in the sacred figures to create an engaging drama in trompe l’oeil. Essentially, the human capabilities redolent of Protagoras’ notion is visually transcribed in the Holy Trinity most evident in the humanisation of God.

Following the renewed interest of the Medici circle and humanist scholars had in art, literature and mythology of the Greco-Roman world, Sandro Botticelli created the Primavera and The Birth of Venus. In both paintings, the central figure is Venus—the goddess of love and beauty. Unlike the clothed Venus in Primavera, the Venus resembling Praxiteles’ Venus Pudica in the latter is nude—once the exponents of sin in Medieval art. However, the rediscovery of ancient ideals and thus Neo-Platonic ideas—divine and spiritual beauty—have restored nude to the heart of creative endeavour in Renaissance paintings which will pave the pursuit to ideal male and female beauty. Inheriting beauty as proportion and harmony, the mature mathematical reflections of Renaissance humanism crucial to achieve anatomical accuracy is materialised in Leonardo’s Vitruvian Man. Nevertheless, the true culmination of the humanist idea that man is the physical representation of God is seen in Michelangelo’s The Creation of Adam in which the figure of Adam embodied the Ideal Male Nude.

The Promotion of Individual Achievement

The development of Renaissance Humanism was profoundly driven by the papal courts and wealthy families such as the Medici family (de facto ruler of Florence). The abundance of paintings, sculpture and architecture infused with Humanist ideas were materialised by private and papal patronage. Primarily, the secularization of the sacred themes could be attributed to the elite families’ commissions. Particularly, artists portrayed living women and men in biblical dramas, sometimes dominating over the sacred figures which subordinates their devotional nature. This practice can be traced as early as Flemish Renaissance in Robert Campin’s Annunciation where its commissioners were painted (similar to Masaccio’s Holy Trinity) in the triptych and the domestic setting for the religious drama.

Besides, the dominating presence of the donor’s family and appearance of the women figures made Ghirlandaio’s Birth of the Virgin an example of the secularisation of sacred themes in Renaissance art. (Kleiner, 480) Their generous commissions were mostly for personal gain and display of material affluence which echoes with the Humanist concept of the promotion of individual achievement and recognition that will extend to the artists themselves.

Subsequently, the artists’ consciousness of their contributions to the Renaissance culture also manifested as their embedded self-portraits and signature in Renaissance paintings. For instance, Jan van Eyck was the first Flemish painter to sign his paintings—first revealed in his Arnolfini Portrait—which will be practiced by other Renaissance painters. Furthermore, embedded self-portraits pervaded Renaissance paintings but are most distinctive in Rogier van der Weyden’s Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin (himself as Saint Luke) and Botticelli’s Adoration of the Magi (full-length portraiture) because they implied the significance and self-conviction of the artists’ status at that time.

Under the doctrines of Humanism, the status of the artist had increased exponentially compared to their medieval counterparts, and the success of Vasari’s Lives of the Artists served as an attestation to the growing interest in the artists’ individual characters and achievements (Huntsman, 200); marking a milestone in the real-life development of Humanism. Notably, the Florentine Medici family played a salient role in recognising artists as respected individual and “extraordinary genius as if they were celestial spirits” (Vasari, 107). This champion aligns with the self-aggrandizement of the painters in their self-portraits, eminently represented by Albrecht Durer’s Self-Portrait in which his awareness of his genius as a demiurge is palpable in his Christ-like self portrait and persona created in his monogram signature.

Succinctly, the concept of Humanism is intricately intertwined with Renaissance paintings. If any, the paragon of humanism in the Renaissance art will be Raphael Sanzio’s School of Athens (Philosophy). With the marvellous execution of perspective schemes and naturalistic figures of contemporary individuals embodying ancient philosophers, the astounding fresco not only serve as an encapsulation of the humanistic zeitgeist but also the impact of Humanism on the evolution of human thinking and art.
