*A little about myself*:

I love Haruki Murakami's books, but I keep going back to Ryunosuke Akutagwa's "A Fool's Life". Although I have deep appreciation for Monet's paintings, Shishkin's paintings still resonate more--in a seemingly metaphysical way--with me. 

I have no idea what I'm doing most of the time and most days I just wish I was a cat or a tree.
