A little about myself:

I'm a Humanities minor specializing in Art History, but I study other stuff too such as Information Systems and Economics. 

I love Haruki Murakami's books, but I keep going back to Ryunosuke Akutagwa's "A Fool's Life". Although I have deep appreciation for Monet's paintings, Ivan Shishkin's paintings still resonate more--in a seemingly metaphysical way--to me. 

I have no idea what I'm doing most of the time and most days I just wish I was a cat; no work, no school, just meow meow.
