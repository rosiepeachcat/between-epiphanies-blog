This 'blog' is a collection of my musings, short stories and essays about art. It started out as an experiment to build a Django blog, but I turned to Jekyll just because it's easier to host the site on Github Pages...  since I already built the blog, then might as well put my writings up there. I hope you'll enjoy reading whatever piques your interest here! Feel free to send me any of your comments--good or bad--[here](https://www.instagram.com/jiasienk/).

A little about myself: I love Haruki Murakami's books, but I keep coming back to Ryunosuke Akutagwa's "A Fool's Life". Although I have deep appreciation for Monet's paintings, Ivan Shishkin's paintings still resonate in a seemingly metaphysical way to me.
